## Drug Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
The development of a drug recommendation system that intelligently suggests suitable medications based on patient symptoms, diagnosis, and health parameters using machine learning, helping healthcare providers support faster and more accurate treatment decisions.

## About
The Drug Recommendation System is an intelligent healthcare support platform designed to recommend appropriate medicines for patients using machine learning techniques. Traditional healthcare consultation requires manual analysis of medical history and symptom evaluation, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project overcomes these challenges by analyzing patient data using predictive models to suggest relevant drugs efficiently and accurately. The system focuses on improving treatment decision support, enhancing healthcare accessibility, and minimizing prescription mismatches.

## Features
Machine learning-based drug recommendation using trained classification models.

Support for analyzing patient inputs such as symptoms, disease type, age, and medical history.

User-friendly web interface for entering patient records and viewing results.

Secure database handling for storing patient data and recommendations.

Real-time prediction and result display with detailed explanation of recommended drugs.

Admin/Doctor dashboard for viewing past recommendations and patient insights.

Scalable design with modular architecture for future integration like EHR systems, hospital databases, and telemedicine platforms.

## Results and Impact

The Drug Recommendation System demonstrates how machine learning can enhance healthcare decision support by intelligently mapping patient symptoms to appropriate medications. It reduces manual workload, minimizes prescription errors, and provides a reliable digital assistant for doctors and healthcare institutions. This project serves as a practical learning platform for applying ML in healthcare and can be extended with real-time hospital data, disease prediction models, and integration with telemedicine platforms. This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
